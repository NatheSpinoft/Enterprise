$What is a Unicast? Identifies an interface on an ipv6 enablerd device
$Multicast? is used to send a single ipv6 packet to multiple destinations
$Anycast? TCan be assigned to multiple drvices and a packet sent to one of these devices that happens to be the nearest receives it.
$IPv6 Broadcast? Does not have a broadcast address, but an all-nodes multicast gives the same result
$IPV6 Addresses? Unicast, Multicast, anycast
$Multicast versions? Assigned, solicited node
$Address for assigned multicast? FF00::/8
$Address for solicited-node? FF:02::1:FF00:0000/104
$Address for Global unicast? 2000::/3 | 3FFF::/3
$Address for link-local? FE80::/10 | FEBF::/10
$Address for loopback? ::1/128
$Address for unspecified? ::/128
$Address for unique local? FC00::/7 FDFF::/7
$Address for embedded IPv4? ::/80
$SLAAC uses this amount as bits for autoconfiguration? 64 bits
$Why is GUA needed? Global Unicast Addresses are similar for public IPv4 address which are routable
$Why is LLA needed? Link local Addresses are required for every IPv6 enabled device and used to communicate with other devices on the same local link. Not routable
$What is so unique about unique local addresses? (RFC 1918) They are used for a local network, not routable as the addresses are used to secure the network from security risks
$A Hex digit contains? 16 bits
$4 Hex digits are called? Hextets
$The first three bits of a GUA address? are being assigned
$What is a global routing prefix? Its assigned by the ISP to a customer
$IPv6 LLA? Enables a device to communicate with other IPv6 enabled devices on the same link and subnet, eveery network interface with IPPv6 must have LLA.
$If an LLA is not configured? If not configured manually the device automatically creates one
$FE80::/10?LLA
$This type of address can be assigned to more than one interface on switches or/and routers but is routed to the nearest one? Anycast
